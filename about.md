I am a full stack software developer with experience in DevOps and currently program with different languages (`Scala`, `PHP`,`Python` `JavaScript`). Other technologies I have worked with are `Lift framework`, `Spark`, `D3.js`, `MySQL`, `Elasticsearch`, `MongoDB`, `CakePHP`, `React`, `HTML` and `CSS`. I am interested in `Machine learning` and `Data Visualization`.

I enjoy learning new things and reading about quite a number of things and watching movies. I also like underdog stories (who doesn't?) and product/ business strategy stories.
